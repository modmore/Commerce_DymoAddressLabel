Dymo Address Label for Commerce
-------------------------------

The Dymo Address Label extension for Commerce (modmo.re/commerce) allows you to print an address label directly
from the order overview in Commerce.

After installing the package, navigate to Extras > Commerce > Configuration > Modules and enable the Dymo Address
Label module in test and/or live mode.

If you have a Dymo LabelWriter installed and connected to your computer, you can now view an order detail page
and should see a print button appear below the customers' address. Clicking it will instantly send it to your printer.

If you don't see the button, check your environment here:

and see the browser developer tools for any potential errors.
