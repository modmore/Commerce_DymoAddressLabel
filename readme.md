Dymo Address Label for Commerce
---

Module for [Commerce](https://www.modmore.com/commerce/) (v0.11+) that allows you to print an address label from the order view with a Dymo Label Writer. 

General instructions:

- Install the package, and make sure the Dymo is connected and ready to print.
- Navigate to an order and click the Print button under the customer address.
- If the print button doesn't show up, your Dymo printer is not available, or the relevant software not installed.

[This environment check](http://labelwriter.com/software/dls/sdk/samples/js/CheckEnvironment/CheckEnvironment.html) can be useful to see if you have the right software installed.

## Installation

Download & install from the modmore package provider. After installation you'll need to enable the module in the Commerce dashboard under Configuration > Modules.
